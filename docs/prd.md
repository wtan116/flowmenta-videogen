# VideoGen Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Overview
VideoGen is an AI-native, multilingual video generation tool built for real estate professionals. Agents can easily produce professional-grade, branded videos by providing minimal inputs like tone, language, market region, and content focus. The tool supports multi-tenant access and integrates with AI and media APIs to deliver downloadable MP4 videos.

## Goals
- Generate high-quality, voice-narrated property or marketing videos from form inputs
- Support multilingual and multi-tone options for personalization
- Enable preview, download, and sharing of created videos
- Ensure tenant-level data isolation and access control
- Scaffold for scalable billing, usage tracking, and module expansion

## Pages
1. **Landing Page** â€“ Public marketing page featuring feature overview, testimonials, and sample videos.
2. **Authentication Page** â€“ Email-based magic link sign-in using Supabase auth.
3. **Agent Onboarding Page** â€“ Collect agent/company info: name, logo, tone, preferred language, and region.
4. **Dashboard** â€“ Personalized view with project settings, usage stats, and video history.
5. **Generate Video Page** â€“ Input form with fields for:
   - Video purpose (listing, testimonial, market update)
   - Language and tone
   - Region/area
   - Optional market insights or notes
6. **Video Library** â€“ Displays generated videos with thumbnails, creation date, preview, download, and share links.
7. **Admin Panel (Phase 2)** â€“ Usage tracking, module access control, billing overview, and error logs.

## Features

### ðŸ”„ Video Creation Workflow
- Frontend input triggers `/api/ai/generate` with:
  ```json
  {
    "project_id": "tenant_001",
    "module": "video",
    "tone": "professional",
    "language": "en",
    "context": {
      "region": "Vancouver",
      "client_type": "seller",
      "market_data": "Listings up 8% YoY"
    }
  }
  ```
- AI writes script (OpenAI or Claude)
- ElevenLabs synthesizes voice
- RunwayML generates visuals
- Final MP4, thumbnail, voice file, and script are uploaded to Google Cloud Storage
- Metadata stored in Supabase `videos` table (with `project_id`-based isolation)

### ðŸ“Š AI Usage Logging
- Logged to `ai_logs` with:
  - Prompt, response
  - Module name
  - Duration, cost, model used
  - Timestamp, user_id, project_id

### ðŸŽ› Multi-Tenant Architecture
- Data access scoped by `project_id`

### ðŸ’³ Billing (Scaffolded in MVP)
- Stripe integration via `user_plans` + `plan_id`
- Plans: Starter ($20), Pro ($39), optional add-ons for voice packs
- Future: Enforce limits via route guards based on `user_plans`

### ðŸ“© Notifications & Help
- Optional: Resend email when new video is ready
- Help center linked via Notion for user onboarding and support

### ðŸ“¦ Storage Architecture
